# Mike Tyson Can’t Sell His Weed Gummies in Colorado

Mike Tyson, who famously [bit Evander Holyfield’s ear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKPMVex-UKk), is now selling THC edibles in the shape of the mangled ear. The name of those gummies: Mike Bites.

The kicker is [he can’t sell them in the US weed capital of Colorado](https://reason.com/2022/04/05/california-cant-mandate-diversity-on-corporate-boards/#markets) due to [a 2016 state law](https://www.westword.com/marijuana/no-more-edibles-shaped-like-animals-fruit-or-humans-in-colorado-9485978) that “prohibits marijuana edibles from being shaped like humans, animals, fruit or other objects that could attract children.”

It turns out the ear-shaped gummy indeed falls under that description. I don’t know about you, but a disfigured ear isn’t exactly the most attractive-looking gummy to eat. Nonetheless the law is the law, and Tyson can’t sell his gummies in the Centennial state. However, if you do want to give them a go, the edibles are currently sold in California with future plans to be sold in more states across the US.
