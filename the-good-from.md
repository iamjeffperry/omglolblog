<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidhoang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Hoang</a> shared <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/08/the-reason-comic-sans-is-a-public-good.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article from The Cut</a> about the font Comic Sans and it raised my eyebrows to learn how accessible this abhorrent font is.</p>

<p>Recently, Instagram added to its Stories an option that looks a lot like Comic Sans, a font design people have long derided. A campaign <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/20/in-defence-comic-sans-font" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to ban the font </a>has been afoot online since 1999.</p>

<p>But, as Lauren Hudgins <a href="https://theestablishment.co/hating-comic-sans-is-ableist-bc4a4de87093#.vukjzcz1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argues</a> for the Establishment, the agreed-upon hatred of Comic Sans reflects a certain navel-gazing, since it’s one of the best fonts for people with dyslexia, including an estimated <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/opinion/sunday/the-upside-of-dyslexia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 percent </a>of Americans.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it’s the idiosyncrasy of Comic Sans that makes it accessible. <span class="pull-double">“</span>The irregular shapes of the letters in Comic Sans allow her to focus on the individual parts of words,” Hudgins writes. <span class="pull-double">“</span>While many fonts use repeated shapes to create different<br>letters, such as a <span class="pull-single">‘</span>p’ rotated to made a <span class="pull-single">‘</span>q,’ Comic Sans uses few repeated shapes, creating distinct letters (although it does have a mirrored <span class="pull-single">‘</span>b’ and <span class="pull-single">‘</span>d’).” The ubiquitous Times New Roman, with all its serifs, is often illegible.</p>

<p>I love the internet because even something as mundane as hating a silly font can have a <span class="pull-double">“</span>turns-out” moment where that same childish font can be helpful for those with different needs.</p>

<p>In fact, I went down a bit of a rabbit hole with this because I remembered there was something one of my favorite apps, <a href="https://reederapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reeder</a>, does that had some connection to dyslexia, but I couldn’t remember what it was.</p>

<p>After some digging, I figured out it was something called <a href="https://bionic-reading.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bionic Reading</a>. According to their website, Bionic Reading’s goal is <span class="pull-double">“</span>a reading system that supports the reading flow. The eye is guided through the text by means of typographic highlights.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To explain what it does, they say that it <span class="pull-double">“</span>revises texts so that the most concise parts of words are highlighted. This guides the eye over the text, and the brain remembers previously learned words more quickly.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where Dyslexia comes involved is further down on their site. It shows that those afflicted with the disability sharing that their experiences with Bionic Reading helped them read more effectively.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>10% of the population has great difficulty reading and understanding texts (dyslexia). We have received feedback from those affected that thanks to Bionic Reading they immediately understood the content of various texts the first time they read them, which was impossible without Bionic Reading. This is pure motivation and also a responsibility towards society, which we are happy to fulfill.</p>
