# The podcast episodes that make me better

I wanted to fulfill my promise of bringing some fun to this issue and share some podcast episodes I listen to fairly often. I have been an avid podcast listener as long as I can remember it being available on iTunes. As someone that drives two hours a day for my day job I fill the time almost exclusively with podcasts. This collection is just the tip of the iceberg for me, and the reason I listen to them multiple times varies. In general, it all boils down to a combination of enjoyment and knowledge. I have left every episode listed below feeling better than I was before I listened. If you want more, I am happy to add to the list in a future issue.

*   [Automators #28: Keyboard Maestro and the Mac](https://www.relay.fm/automators/28) - Keyboard Maestro was Shortcuts for the Mac before Shortcuts can’t to the Mac. It has so much power and this episode gave me a taste of the app and what you can do with it.
*   [Longform: Jenny Odell](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-352-jenny-odell) - This podcast opened my mind in many ways, mostly in ways I can’t articulate here in this newsletter. If you ever feel like you are on the internet too much, have caught yourself [Doomscrolling](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/), this is a podcast that is worth a listen. You can also buy Jenny’s book, _[How to do Nothing](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/9781612197494/)_, and gain even more insight.
*   [Compound Writing: How to Design a Sustainable Daily Writing Workflow for Blogs and Newsletters with Michael Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqg8zzZAWD0) - Michael gives a talk about his story in making _[The Supercreator](https://www.thesupercreator.com/)_, what he did to brand and define his newsletter, how he writes daily, and what you can do to stand out. Michael is a genuinely nice person and graciously gave me a half hour of his time to chat with me about _Tablet Habit_ as I got started with it. If I ever feel lost or want to make sure I am doing the right thing with this newsletter I listen to this.
*   [Media Voices Podcast: Man cannot live by newsletter alone, the realities of going solo as a journalist](https://voices.media/man-cannot-live-newsletter-alone-realities-going-solo-journalist/) - An audio documentary showcasing newsletter writers in all stages of their writing careers. This is some fantastic reporting, interviewing, and editing to show the good and bad sides of newsletter writing. It doesn’t just show the wildly successful stories, it also shows when things don’t work out and what those people have learned from it. This is easily one of the best pieces about the creator economy I have consumed in the past year.
*   [43 Folders Podcast: John Gruber & Merlin Mann’s Blogging Panel At SxSW](https://www.43folders.com/2009/03/25/blogs-turbocharged) - Merlin Mann and John Gruber have a talk at SxSW in 2009 where they talk about what makes for good blogging. Really, this talk is about creating things online in general. Online publishing as changed dramatically since 2009, but very little about this talk has seemed to become obsolete after more than a decade since it was given.
*   [Mac Power Users #583: The Obsidian Deep Dive](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/583) \- David Sparks and Stephen Hackett dive deep into Obsidian and helps newbies to the app understand what it is, what it can do, and how you can make it work for you. There have been a few meaningful updates since this episode went live but it’s still suitable for those getting started.
*   [Automators #71: Automated Capture](https://www.relay.fm/automators/71) - David Sparks and Rosemary Orchard show how to handle capturing ideas, tasks, notes, etc. and what to do to ensure you have a system that works.
*   [Do By Friday: The Doodler](https://dobyfriday.com/episodes/79) - This isn’t a normal productivity podcast, so be warned about that. That said, this is my favorite podcast to listen to to get back to the basics of Drafts. The hosts have creator of the Drafts app, Greg Pierce, on as a guest and talk about what Drafts is, what it can do, and how you can make it your own. If you want a fantastic text editor that holds a lot of power user options download Drafts and give this a listen. Bonus points if you listen to their later episodes, [one revisiting Drafts to do more with it](https://dobyfriday.com/episodes/171), the other [where they write their texts in Drafts](https://dobyfriday.com/episodes/133).
*   [Automators #73: Custom Drafts Themes, Syntax, and more with Tim Nahumck](https://www.relay.fm/automators/73) - Tim, who is a friend of mine, shares how one of the latest updates to Drafts allows you to use custom themes and custom syntax. This is for the people that already use Drafts. If you aren’t familiar with the app I suggest you listen to the previous episode of Do By Friday.
