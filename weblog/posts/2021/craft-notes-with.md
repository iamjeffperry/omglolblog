# Craft Notes 101 with James Eaton
Today I am happy to present a Craft 101 video with James Eaton where he walks me through how to set up my Craft notes system, what I can do to make it more useful, and how to get the most out of this app.

This was a lot of fun to make and I canâ€™t wait to see how it helps anyone looking to set up a Crafts notes system.

Things included in this video:

*   How to organize your notes
*   How to make Craft a [PKM system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)
*   The difference between notes, pages, cards, and blocks
*   How to make a wiki for a person/author
*   Many quick tips

I want to thank [James](http://twitter.com/jameseaton) for being a part of this and I hope to make a more advanced walkthrough with James in the near future as I get more time with Craft and look to take the next step with it.
