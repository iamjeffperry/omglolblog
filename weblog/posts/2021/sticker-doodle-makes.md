# Sticker Doodle makes messaging fun again

Chad Etzel, who recently went independent, released one of the most fun apps for the iPhone this year.

If you like to have stickers in messages but always wanted to make your own you are now able to with a few taps and swipes. You can use your camera, saved photos, or draw your own! This is honestly the first app that had made stickers fun for me since it was released on iOS.

Best part? [You can share the stickers you make within the app](https://twitter.com/jazzychad/status/1432795284413706242?s=20).
