# A Better Shade of Blue

[Daniel Jalkut on Red Sweater’s blog](https://redsweater.com/blog/4010/marsedit-5-0-5-a-better-shade-of-blue):

> A few weeks ago, I found myself staring at the about box for the app, and this default shade of blue stood out to me:

Old Blue Shade of MarsEdit

> There’s nothing _particularly_ wrong with it. It is, after all, the [default color for all links](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#the-css-user-agent-style-sheet-and-presentational-hints). But I’m not sure anybody spent much time weighing the aesthetics of the default HTML colors. To my eye, the saturation reads “1990s” and “Windows”. When I see that default color on a web site, the site comes across as less refined. And suddenly, my app felt less refined as well. Here’s how the same default link looks in MarsEdit 5.0.5:

New Shade of Blue on MarsEdit

> It’s just another arbitrary color, but it’s my choice. I think it looks nice. It’s a better shade of blue. I liked it so much I changed the default blue in MarsEdit’s Plain Text syntax highlighting as well.

I know this is a really simple change but it reminds me of what my thought process was when I made this website. I spent so much time trying to kill and default blue links that were around.

Also, the shade of blue Daniel Jalkut chose is damn near perfect.
