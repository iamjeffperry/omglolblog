# Solo Acts: Marco Arment and his podcast app Overcast

Ashley Esqueda has been making a great mini-series withing _Vergecast_ called _Solo Acts_ where she interviews solo entrepreneurs making awesome things on the internet. In her final episode [she had Marco Arment on](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/20/23648650/marco-arment-overcast-solo-acts) and it did not disappoint.

I have long been a fan of Marcoâ€™s work and to hear the story behind Tumblr, Instapaper, and Overcast in one place is fantastic.
