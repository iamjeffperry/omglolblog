# Huge Changes for New Mastodon Users

People signing up for Mastodon will no longer have to worry about what server to go to. Instead, Mastodon will now be defaulting to a server they operate. Eugen Rochko, Mastodon’s Founder and CEO, [explained](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/?ref=jeffperry.me) his reasoning for this saying that “\[m\]aking the onboarding process as easy as possible helps new users get past the sign-up process and more quickly engage with others.”

**ZOOM OUT:** The balancing act between usability and the open web is upon us. Instead of focusing on the decentralization of Mastodon, they are opting to choose something more closed.

*   This follows a more centralized platform like Facebook and Twitter. Though you can change servers.
*   Bluesky, Mastodon’s competitor, is also known to do something like this as well for new users.
