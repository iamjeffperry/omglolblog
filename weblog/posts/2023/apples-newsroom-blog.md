<p>Tonight, I noticed something curious about Apple’s latest post to their official Newsroom, a blog of sorts where the company makes public statements and press releases. The post regarding the opening dates for their two newest retail stores is categorized as a <span class="pull-single">‘</span>Quick Read’, complete with a lightening bolt icon and pop-up interaction from the main Newsroom feed.</p>

<p>Still, it’s nice to see Apple join in on the return of personal blogging with something new, however minor it may be, on their blog.</p>

<p>Jarrod also makes a list of a lot of posts from Apple with similar word counts but significantly different categories.</p>
