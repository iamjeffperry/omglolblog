Today _Techdirt_ released their second game, _[Moderator Mayhem](https://moderatormayhem.engine.is/)_ . It is a "game that lets you see how good a job you would do as a front line content moderator," Mike Masnick writes, "for a growing technology company that hosts user-generated content".

Not only does the game have you moderate content, but it also gives you feedback from your manager and the public.

> Are you supportive of free speech, or too oppressive in your moderation? Are you allowing too much harassment and therefore not considered safe? One thing about the public is that theyâ€™re not shy about letting you know how they feel.

I did my first run on my lunch break at work and I absolutely plan to play more with this later.

Techdirt has managed to, once again, provide some fantastic context to what is going on in big tech and the platforms we all know and love.
