# Bard Fork, and How to Talk So Chatbots Will Listen

[_Hard Fork_](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/podcasts/hard-fork-technology.html) is a show that I slept on far too long and as someone that has interviewed Casey before I feel shame admitting it. [This episode in particular](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/podcasts/hard-fork-bard.html?action=click&module=audio-series-bar&region=header&pgtype=Article) really grabbed on to me, and it was so good I plan to listen to it again in a few days.

In short hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton asked their listeners to send in examples of how they are using AI in their lives and some of the examples given made me want to open my laptop and start playing around with what AI tools I have available.
