# The Talk Show ep. 370 - ‘Fine Hypertext Products’, with Jason Kottke

I will always [listen to Gruber and Kottke talk about their tenured careers as bloggers](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/03/11/ep-370) and hearing them talk about the past 25 years of blogging made me really consider how I want my writing online to look like. In fact, after listening to this episode I did the following:

*   Curated all of my content into one space
*   Realized I wanted to write shorter posts more frequently instead of long newsletters on something like Substack
*   Decided that one personal brand is better than multiple brands
*   Come up with a tagline for my site: “outward links, inward essays”
