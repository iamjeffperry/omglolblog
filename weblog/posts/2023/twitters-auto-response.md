# Twitter’s Auto Response to the Press is a Poop Emoji

Twitter, AKA the “Free Speech” platform is now changing how they respond to journalists looking to get information from the company. Instead of a reply either giving journalists doing their job or even a simple “no comment” Twitter is now auto-responding with a poop emoji.

If you’re wondering if this is a joke played by a disgruntled employee I have bad news for you, it’s coming from the head moron in charge.
