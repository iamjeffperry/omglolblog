# Too Many to Manage

[Gabz](https://gabz.blog/2023/04/too-many-to-manage):

> The chatty-chat-social media landscape has become a little overwhelming, for me, since Twitter's collapse. I find myself juggling and managing;

> The only reason Wavelength seems somewhat appealing is that in any group that I am part of, no one sees or would have my phone number, unlike Telegram or WhatsApp, as far as I know. Still, I am not sure I want to manage this many things.

The competition for chat apps has began to get quite saturated to say the least. Like most things many people will pick where _most_ of their people are and let the rest fall to the wayside. For me Mastodon is the biggest one, but I am using 3-5 other ones to keep up with everything going on in this space.
