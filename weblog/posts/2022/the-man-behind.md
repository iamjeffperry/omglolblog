Steve Sheraton went from making a silly video online where he was drinking a beer with his iPhone into a full-fledged app, which then became a breakout star when the App Store launched.

There is [a great piece](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/ibeer-app-history) from MEL by Quinn Myers about her. Without spoiling it, Myers goes more in-depth about what happens to Sheraton _after_ iBeer’s success.

If you read the MEL article and find that interesting, Sheraton [recently did an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/u8saaq/im_a_magician_and_inventor_who_created_ibeer_the/) where he talks more about iBeer’s success, what he is doing now, and his feelings on developing apps out today.
